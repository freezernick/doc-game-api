# Sessions

Sessions are used to tell Game Jolt when a user is playing a game, and what state they are in while playing (active, or idle).

Sessions are currently only shown to other users in the Public Chat. In the near future, this data will become more visible on the site, for example:

- Sessions will be shown as live activity to friends as Game Jolt becomes social.
- Gamers will be able to see which games they (and their friends) have invested the most time in.
- Developers will be able to see the total play time of their games.
