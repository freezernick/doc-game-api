# Trophies

## Description

Game Jolt allows you to add Trophies in to your games!
Trophies come in four materials: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. This is to reflect how difficult it is to achieve a trophy. A bronze trophy should be easy to achieve whereas a platinum trophy should be very hard to achieve.
On Game Jolt, Trophies are always listed in in order from most easily achievable to most difficult.
You can also tag trophies on the site as "secret." This is where a trophy's image and description is not visible until a gamer has achieved it.
