# Data-Storage

The Data-Storage is a cloud based storage system.
Every game has its own Data-Storage to store all kinds of information in.

The Data-Storage is split into Global and User storages. The Global storage can be accessed from every user, while the user-specific storage can only be accessed by the very specific user.

__Some things developers have achieved with the Data-Storage system:__

- Global Game Statistics
- User-Specific Statistics
- Private Messaging System
- User-Generated Content Hosting, e.g. Level Packs
- Turn Based Strategy Games
- Instant Replay System

__Note:__

The Data-Storage is limited to 16MB per key.
