# Trophies

Game Jolt allows you to add trophies to your games!

Trophies come in four materials: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. This is to reflect how difficult it is to achieve a trophy. A bronze trophy should be easy to achieve, whereas a platinum trophy should be very hard to achieve.

On Game Jolt, trophies are always listed in order from easiest to most difficult to achieve.

You can also tag trophies on the site as "secret". A sercet trophy's image and description is not visible until a gamer has achieved it.
